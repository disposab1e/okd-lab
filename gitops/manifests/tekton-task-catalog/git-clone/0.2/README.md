# `git-clone`

**Please Note: this Task is only compatible with Tekton Pipelines versions 0.14.0 and greater!**

This `Task` has two required inputs:

1. The URL of a git repo to clone provided with the `url` param.
2. A Workspace called `output`.

The `git-clone` `Task` will clone a repo from the provided `url` into the
`output` Workspace. By default the repo will be cloned into the root of
your Workspace. You can clone into a subdirectory by setting this `Task`'s
`subdirectory` param. If the directory where the repo will be cloned is
already populated then by default the contents will be deleted before the
clone takes place. This behaviour can be disabled by setting the
`deleteExisting` param to `"false"`.

This `Task` does the job of the legacy `GitResource` `PipelineResource` and
is intended as its replacement. This is part of our plan to [offer replacement
`Tasks` for Pipeline Resources](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/issues/95)
as well as
[document those replacements](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/1369).

### Workspaces

* **output**: A workspace for this Task to fetch the git repository in to.

### Parameters

* **url**: git url to clone (_required_)
* **revision**: git revision to checkout (branch, tag, sha, refâ€¦) (_default_: "")
* **refspec**: git refspec to fetch before checking out revision (_default_:"")
* **submodules**: defines if the resource should initialize and fetch the submodules (_default_: true)
* **depth**: performs a shallow clone where only the most recent commit(s) will be fetched (_default_: 1)
* **sslVerify**: defines if http.sslVerify should be set to true or false in the global git config (_default_: true)
* **subdirectory**: subdirectory inside the "output" workspace to clone the git repo into (_default:_ "")
* **deleteExisting**: clean out the contents of the repo's destination directory if it already exists before cloning the repo there (_default_: true)
* **httpProxy**: git HTTP proxy server for non-SSL requests (_default_: "")
* **httpsProxy**: git HTTPS proxy server for SSL requests (_default_: "")
* **noProxy**: git no proxy - opt out of proxying HTTP/HTTPS requests (_default_: "")
* **verbose**: log the commands that are executed during `git-clone`'s operation (_default_: true)
* **gitInitImage**: the image used where the git-init binary is (_default_: "gcr.io/tekton-releases/github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/cmd/git-init:v0.17.3")

### Results

* **commit**: The precise commit SHA that was fetched by this Task
* **url**: The precise URL that was fetched by this Task

## Usage

If the `revision` is not provided in the param of the taskrun
then it will auto-detect the branch as specified by the `default`
in the respective git repository.

The following pipelines demonstrate usage of the git-clone Task:

- [Cloning a branch](../0.2/samples/git-clone-checking-out-a-branch.yaml)
- [Checking out a specific git commit](../0.2/samples/git-clone-checking-out-a-commit.yaml)
- [Checking out a git tag and using the "commit" Task Result](../0.2/samples/using-git-clone-result.yaml)
