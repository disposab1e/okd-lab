## JFROG ARTIFACTORY SYSTEM CONFIGURATION FILE
## HOW TO USE: comment-out any field and keep the correct yaml indentation by deleting only the leading '#' character.

configVersion: 1

## NOTE: JFROG_HOME is a place holder for the JFrog root directory containing the deployed product, the home directory for all JFrog products.
## Replace JFROG_HOME with the real path!
## For example, in RPM install, JFROG_HOME=/opt/jfrog

## NOTE: Sensitive information such as passwords and join key are encrypted on first read.
## NOTE: The provided commented key and value is the default.

## SHARED CONFIGURATIONS
